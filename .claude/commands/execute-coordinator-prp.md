# Execute Coordinator Pattern PRP

## PRP File: $ARGUMENTS

Execute the implementation of the Coordinator Pattern PRP following Context Engineering principles with thorough validation and quality assurance.

## Execution Strategy

### 1. PRP Analysis and Validation
- Parse the PRP file and extract all implementation requirements
- Validate that all necessary context and dependencies are available
- Confirm understanding of success criteria and validation gates
- Identify any missing information or clarifications needed

### 2. Implementation Approach
- Follow the task breakdown exactly as specified in the PRP
- Implement each component with full error handling and validation
- Use the specified patterns and examples from the codebase
- Ensure all code follows the project's coding standards and conventions

### 3. Validation Loop Execution
- Execute each validation gate as specified in the PRP
- Fix any issues found during validation before proceeding
- Ensure all tests pass and code quality checks succeed
- Validate integration points and end-to-end functionality

### 4. Quality Assurance
- Run comprehensive testing suite
- Perform security and performance validation
- Ensure documentation is complete and accurate
- Validate that all success criteria are met

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow Pydantic AI best practices and patterns
- Use async/await throughout for consistency
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Include comprehensive type hints and documentation
- Follow the project's existing code structure and conventions

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all components with >80% coverage
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Include edge case and error condition testing

### Documentation Standards
- Clear docstrings for all classes and functions
- Usage examples and integration guides
- API reference documentation
- Troubleshooting and FAQ sections

## Execution Process

1. **Setup Phase**: Create project structure and dependencies
2. **Core Implementation**: Build all components as specified in PRP
3. **Integration Phase**: Connect components and test workflows
4. **Validation Phase**: Execute all validation gates
5. **Documentation Phase**: Complete all documentation requirements
6. **Final Review**: Ensure all success criteria are met

## Success Validation

Before marking the PRP as complete, verify:
- [ ] All tasks from the PRP task breakdown are completed
- [ ] All validation gates pass successfully
- [ ] Code quality meets project standards (ruff, mypy, tests)
- [ ] Integration tests demonstrate end-to-end functionality
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Performance meets specified requirements
- [ ] Security validation passes
- [ ] All success criteria from PRP are satisfied

## Error Handling

If any step fails:
1. Analyze the specific failure and root cause
2. Refer back to PRP context and examples for guidance
3. Fix the issue following established patterns
4. Re-run validation to confirm fix
5. Continue with remaining implementation

## Output Requirements

Provide clear status updates throughout execution:
- Progress on each major task
- Results of validation gates
- Any issues encountered and how they were resolved
- Final summary of deliverables and their status
- Confirmation that all success criteria are met

Remember: The goal is to implement a production-ready Coordinator Pattern system that perfectly matches the PRP specifications and passes all validation requirements.
